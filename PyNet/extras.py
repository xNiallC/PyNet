'One man. One desire. The goal to create a device protect himself and those around him, the only way he knew how.
Python.' The words echo in your (Kirill Sodorov, Expert Programmer, Overall Nice Guy) head. Years of planning,
programming, bug fixing, getting angry, and progressive montages led to this moment. Over a cup of lukewarm coffee,
you finish the last function:- 'def killcode'. You lean back and revel in your own glory, ready to get a good
night's sleep to prepare for the big presentation in the University tomorrow. Researchers from round the country are
coming to witness your brainchild. This could be your big break. Let's hope everything goes to plan. You didn't
forget to logoff the lecture hall computer did you?

"C:\\users\Kirill\Protectotron> Disengaging ethical decontamination. Subject no longer protected. Was it something I said?"
You did it!
Well kind of.. there is the small matter of the onslaught that you may have indirectly caused, not to mention the legal
implications you now find yourself in, all neatly packaged with the unfathomable guilt and remorse you owe towards each
victim and their families. As the saying goes I'm selfish, impatient, and a little insecure. I make mistakes.
But, at the end of the day, you are the hero Gotham deserves, but not the one it needs right now. I mean Cardiff. Whatever,
you saved the day, even if you did cause it."""

Yeah I'm pretty sure that wasn't the right piece of code. Well at least you definitely won't get freshers flu now.
I hope you've played Fallout, cause by tomorrow you'll be defending yourself from Deathclaws and hoarding items. Perhaps
we have the foundation for the sequel? Good luck anyway. I'm sure nuclear apocalypse wasn't in your lecture notes."""
