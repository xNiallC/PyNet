Things I've added on top of the template:
  
   * created a dict in the map that gives rooms requirements to enter
  
   * created function (try_enter_room) that checks if you have an item that meets the requirements to enter the room
  
   * moved some of the move functions into the try_enter_room function 
  
   * created examine function
  
   * made error text more humourous
  
   * cleaned up menu, prints item in a list rather than seperate commands
 
   * created cough syrup item for fun



Bugs/changes list. Not really sure how to go about some of these. Callum.

	* once phone is taken from the reception, the description will always read “there 	is a phone here etc..”

	* before approaching the shadowy figure, there could be another option like “go 	back” which prompts a response of “mad bro? you’ve got a presentation to do.” just 	to help make the game feel less linear at that point.

	*maybe change the name of room of respect paying so the user doesn’t think they’re 	actually in another room.
