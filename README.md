Things I've added on top of the template:
  created a dict in the map that gives rooms requirements to enter
  created function (try_enter_room) that checks if you have an item that meets the requirements to enter the room
  moved some of the move functions into the try_enter_room function 
  created examine function
  made error text more humourous
  cleaned up menu, prints item in a list rather than seperate commands
  created cough syrup item for fun
